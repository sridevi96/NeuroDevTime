# Cell type-Agnostic Transcriptomic Signatures Enable Uniform Comparisons of Neurodevelopment 
* This repository contains cell type agnostic models to predict the developmental age of brain cell types from single cell RNAseq data. <br> 
* Code contains 4 jupyter notebooks, which apply pretrained models to predict neurodevelopmental age of cell types in new human fetal brain and organoid datasets. <br>
* Models, data, and processed data needed to run these notebooks are provided in the zenodo repository https://zenodo.org/records/14908186 <br>
